        GLOSSARY

        IEEE 802.11
        Standard to encourage interoperability among
        wireless networking equipment.

        Access point (AP)
        Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device
        that commonly connects and transports data
        between a wireless network and a wired network.

        Access control (AC)
        To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge
        wireless and wired network.

        Fat AP
        Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could
        work independently without help from AC.

        Fit AP
        Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work
        under the control and management from AC.

        Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol
        The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control
        and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF.
        Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP.

        BSS
        IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell).  The
        BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly
        associating with the AP.

        Radio
        The chip set to receive and send wireless signal.

        Association
        The service used to establish access point
        or station mapping and enable STA invocation
        of the distribution system services.
        (Wireless clients attempt to connect to
        access points.)

        Basic Rate
        A data rate that is mandatory for client
        devices to support in order for them to achieve
        successful association." "Platform Team H3C Technologies Co., Ltd.
